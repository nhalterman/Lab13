My prediction prediction for insertion is probably 30 seconds
for quick sort it might be doubled as insertion
for java sort it is probably way more efficient so probably maybe like 5 seconds
Selection sort would be really close to quick sort.

4. According to my data the ranking from best to worst would be java sort, insertion sort, selection sort, and then quick sort.
